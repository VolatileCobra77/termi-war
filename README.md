# OVERVIEW
Termi-war is a (to my knowledge) one-of-a kind game. It is a War simulation that takes place WITHIN your filesystem. The premise is simple, two teams at war with one annother, red team and blue team. You start in a directory called the master, each team creates its own sub-directory. an additional sub-directory is created called no-mans-land. This directiory is where the "overlord" creates resources, and other useful files to the teams. parts of no-mans-land can be claimed by scouts from either side. Resources are required to create new directories, nodes (troops or other combatant files), defenses, dummies (files that present themselves as the FLAG for capture) and to move your FLAG. The FLAG (Fully Linked Arethmetic Generator) is the node that creates your troops, communicates with them, and stages attacks. once it is deleted, the game is over and the other side wins. 

# DISCLAIMER
This game operates in two modes, SAFE mode which will not delete any files outside of the specified directory, and DESTRUCTION mode, which starts the game in the / directory and can delete or modify any file that the user running the "overlord" can. DESTRUCTION mode WILL delete any file it sees fit to make space for new nodes, attempt to harm communication or sabatoge the other team. USE AT YOUR OWN DISCRESSION
